- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It makes it easier as there is less typing and initializing involved like we discussed in class. It was a little difficult figuring out the syntax again, but looking at the code demos again, it was easy to figure out what I was missing. I found myself able to dive into the code quickly without having to worry about creating the structure first which increased my motivation as I find the necessary beginnings of Java the hardest step to start and finish. 

The methods worked and the majority of the things outlined in the README were easy to implement or were easy after more interpretation. However, in every file, I get an error saying that the attributes of the Building class are not used: name, address, and the number of floors all give a yellow underlined variable, but I was able to fix it by adding an accessor to grab and print the building parameters. That got rid of the error successfully.  Some advice I would give is to understand inheritance and try to make this code as realistic as possible. Also, don't be afraid to add things that weren't specifically outlined in the README file, as long as you have the minimum, it should work and be a good start to the code.
